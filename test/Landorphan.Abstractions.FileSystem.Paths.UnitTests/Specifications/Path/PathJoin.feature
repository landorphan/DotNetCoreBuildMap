Feature: Path Join
	In order to work with paths
	As a developer
	I need to be able to join paths


#Scenario Outline: Join a path to a path
	#Given I have the following path: <Target>
	#And I have the following path: <Other>
	# When I call target Join other
	# Then <Target> should be unmodified
	# And <Other> should be unmodified
	# And The Join result should be a new instance
	# And the Join result should have the expected value
