Feature: WindowsPaths
	In order to reliably interact with the file systems of multiple platforms
	As a developer
	I want to be able to parse paths on multiple platforms correctly

Scenario Outline: Drive Rooted Paths
	Given I have the following path: <Path>
	 When I parse the path as a Windows Path
     And I evaluate the original form
	 Then I should receive a path object
	  And segment '0' should be: <Root>
	  And segment '1' should be: <Segment 1>
	  And segment '2' should be: <Segment 2>
	  And segment '3' should be: <Segment 3>
	  And the path should be anchored to <Anchor>
	  And the parse status should be <Status>
	  And the segment length should be <Length>
	  And the PathType should be Windows
# NOTE: Due to Gherkin parsing rules, \ needs to be escaped.  In order to avoid that necissity and
# make the following examples easier to read (`) will be used in place of the (\) character
#
# NOTES:
# Per the spec, the following characters are illegal (anywere in the path)
# ILLEGAL CHARACTERS: Less Than (<), Greater Than (>), Double Quote ("), Pipe (|), Asterisk (*)
# 
# Per the spec, the following characters always represent a Path Separator regarless of location and can not be part of the path
# Foward Slash (/), Back Slash (\)
#
# Per the spec, the following characters are reserved and have special meaning.  They are only legal in or before the first segmant
# Colon (:) - Legal in first segment, Question Mark (?) - Legal only before the first segment (when using "long" sentax)
#
# Path Segment Type Shorthand:
# {N} = NullSegment, {E} = EmptySegment, {R} = RootSegment, {D} = DeviceSegment, {/} = VolumelessRootSegment
# {V} = VolumeRelativeSegment, {U} = UncSegment, {G} = Segment, {.} = SelfSegmentk, {..} = ParentSegment
